# Golf Round Tracker

## App Description

Users will be able to use the app to add their favorite golf courses and track how well they shot during their recent rounds. They will be able to make an account which will allow them to customize their recent rounds. Users will be able to add courses to their index page, and once the course is created, they will be able to add information to that course such as the date they played, score they shot, and any additional details. A public api will be used to fetch what the course par is and post it to the course page (a maybe a picture for the course?).

### App Requirements:

- Each user will be able to make an account where they can add their favorite golf courses and keep track of their recent rounds that they played
- There will be a nav bar for easy navigation throughout the apps' pages
- Index page will look like a grid and will display the courses name, a picture of the course, and the course par
- On each course page, users will be able to document recent rounds they have played at that course
- Users will be able to track multiple rounds on the same course show page, and be able to make edits and deletions
- Users will have the option to remove courses from their index page, or remove specific rounds from the show page

### Stretch Goals:

- Track individual holes for each course
    - Drop down menu for each date that includes each hole
- Make the app interactive, such as sharing when other users added a new round and allowing other users to comment on the post, similar to social media


### Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS and Bootstrap
- Javascrtipt
- Mongo / Mongoose
